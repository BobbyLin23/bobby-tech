Hey, I am Bobby Lin, a rookie full stack developer.

Life is hard, and I am just a normal person. I want to become a better man, but the way to it is always full of hardships and challenges. So this website is a record of my self-change.

I am mainly focused on Vue, React, and Nest.js related technology, and I am willing to use new cool things such as Svelte, Solid, and Astroâ€¦

To gain the freedom of my life, I am trying to devote myself to Open Source and Independent development. I want to build something to affect the world a bit. This is a long way, but I am insistent on it.

By the way, I am an INFJ and I am super nervous in real life, but I am happy to make new friends, so please [email me](mailto:linzhangsheng23@gmail.com) for fun and I will be happy to chat with you!!
